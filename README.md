# TCX Converter

A program I wrote a long, long time ago when first learning Ruby
It converts TCX files (a Polar version of XML) to .csv

Thinking about cleaning it up and adding unit tests in minitest

Kind of a pointless program now since Polar allows you to export CSV files, but they didn't used to when I wrote this
